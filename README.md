This game currently has a filestructure where you should run all code from main.py which will contain the main game loop and instantiate and delete any gameobjects. sprites.py should contain any classes for game objects for us to use this should include child and parent classes. settings.py shoould be used for any global constants that need to bee used throughout the program. If the size/scale of the project gets too big the we should be able to adjust the file structure for clarity
